# Quizard
Quizard is a flashcard app for Android, which I am building in a CodePath mini-course.
## Lab 4

### App Description
This app presents a user with a question, and allows them to tap the question to produce an answer, similar to using a flashcard.
In this version, styling and animations have been added to the app to make it more visually appealing.
